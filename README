This is an implementation of the BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding
Detection) protocol.

It consists of two processes:
  - bfd:  runs just a single BFD session using parameters specified
          on the command line
  - bfdd: can support multiple BFD sessions that are specified
          either statically in a config file or dynamically via a
          control socket; a library is provided for communicating
          with bfdd over the control socket to create sessions and
          receive session state change notifications

Dependencies:
- libconfig
